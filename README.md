# Everything in js happens inside the "Execution context"

# There are two parts in Execution context -- Variable Enviroment and Thread of Exewcution
# Variable Environment -- Memory component -- contains variables and functions -- where data is stored in key-value paior and Thread of Execution is the code compoenent where the js code is processed -- step by step

# JS is a synchronous (in a specific order) single-threaded (one command at a time) language
